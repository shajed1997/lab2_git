Learning Outcome:
By the end of this lab, students will be able to effectively use Git to manage and collaborate on
software projects. Specifically, they will be able to:
1. Commit Changes: Understand and execute the process of staging and committing
changes to a local Git repository, including writing meaningful commit messages that
accurately reflect the nature of the changes.
2. Create and Manage Branches: Demonstrate the ability to create, switch between, and
delete branches to isolate and manage different lines of development within a project.
3. Push Changes: Effectively push local commits to a remote repository, ensuring that
changes are synchronized and available to collaborators.
4. Merge Branches: Execute branch merging operations to integrate changes from one
branch into another, including resolving conflicts that may arise during the merge
process.
5. Create and Manage Pull Requests: Create, review, and manage pull requests in a
remote repository hosting service (e.g., GitHub) to propose changes, conduct code
reviews, and facilitate collaborative development.
